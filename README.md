## Usage

When you first open the site, you are presented with the About Me page of my portfolio. There is a navigation element that changes color based on the page you are on, and there is a footer element that includes links to my GitHub, Indeed, and Twitter accounts. Both of these elements persist on every page. There are three more pages: a Porfolio page of my top projects, a Contact form page, and a Resume page that lists my proficiencies and includes a downloadable pdf of my resume.
